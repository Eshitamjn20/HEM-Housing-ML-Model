##Project Introduction

Predicting housing prices is vital for buyers, sellers, and investors. In this project, we predict Melbourne housing prices based on factors such as the number of rooms, bathrooms, proximity to the Central Business District (CBD), and nearby school facilities. We use machine learning models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Polynomial Regression to achieve this.

## Data Source

- Kaggle: Melbourne Housing Market
This dataset includes a variety of features, including property type, suburb, number of rooms, price, sale date, and distance from the CBD.
- Additional Data: Schools per Suburb
We enriched the dataset with schooling data from the Victorian Government dataset, which includes the number of schools per suburb. This is important to assess how school proximity influences property prices.
