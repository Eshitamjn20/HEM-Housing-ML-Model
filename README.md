## Project Introduction : 
Residential housing is a vital aspect of individuals' and families' daily lives, making it important to understand the shifts in property prices. These fluctuations impact not only homebuyers but also real estate agents, sellers, and investors who need accurate insights into the market.

This project utilizes Machine Learning (ML) to develop a predictive model that analyzes key factors influencing residential property prices in Melbourne, such as rooms, bathrooms, distance from the CBD, and schooling facilities. The model is designed to provide users with an interactive tool on a webpage, allowing them to explore and predict property prices based on these factors.

## Data Source: 
This project leverages two key datasets.  The primary dataset, sourced from Kaggle, consists of real estate data scraped from Domain.com.au, which includes details such as address, property type, suburb, selling method, number of rooms, price, real estate agent, sale date, and distance from the CBD. Although the dataset was raw, we cleaned and processed it to focus on key features that enhance the accuracy of our machine learning models for predicting housing prices. Additionally, we incorporated a schooling dataset to calculate the number of schools per suburb, providing a crucial factor in analyzing regional desirability and its effect on property prices.
